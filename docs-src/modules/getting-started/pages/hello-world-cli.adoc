= Hello World (CLI)

== Installation

To use Kaskada on the command line, you'll need to install three components:

* The Kaskada command-line executable
* The Kaskada manager, which serves the Kaskada API
* The Kaskada engine, which executes queries

Each Kaskada release has pre-compiled binaries for each component. 
You can visit the https://github.com/kaskada-ai/kaskada/releases[Releases] page on Github to obtain the latest Kaskada release version binaries for your platform.
The example commands below will download the latest Kaskada binaries and applies to Linux and OSX.


[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaskada-ai/kaskada/main/install/install.sh)"
----


== Update PATH (optional)

Update your environment's `PATH` to include the downloaded binaries. If this is not preferred, skip this section.

Print a colon-separated list of the directories in your `PATH`.

[source,bash]
----
echo $PATH
----

Move the Kaskada binaries to one of the listed locations. 
This command assumes that the binaries are currently in your working directory and that your `PATH` includes `/usr/local/bin`, but you can customize it if your locations are different.

[source,bash]
----
mv kaskada-* /usr/local/bin/
----

[TIP]
.Authorizing applications on OSX
====
If you're using OSX, you may need to unblock the applications.
OSX prevents applications you download from running as a security feature.
You can remove the block placed on the file when it was downloaded with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine kaskada-cli
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine kaskada-manager
xattr -w com.apple.quarantine kaskada-engine
----
====

== Start the services 

You can start a local instance of the Kaskada service by running the manager and engine:

[source,bash]
----
./kaskada-manager 2>&1 > manager.log 2>&1 &
./kaskada-engine serve > engine.log 2>&1 &
----

[TIP]
.Allowing services to listen on OSX
====
When using OSX, you may need to allow these services to create an API listener the first time you run these commands.
This is normal, and indicates the services are working as expected - the API allows services to communicate between themselves.
====

To verify they're installed correctly and executable, try running the following command (which lists any resources you've created):

[source,bash]
----
./kaskada-cli sync export --all
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,bash]
----
10:18AM INF starting export
{}  
10:18AM INF Success!
----

== Loading Data into a Table

Kaskada stores data in _tables_. Tables consist of multiple rows, and
each row is a value of the same type.
When querying Kaskada, the contents of a table are interpreted as a xref:fenl:continuity.adoc[discrete timestream]: the value associated with each event corresponds to a value in the timestream.

=== Creating a Table

Every table is associated with a schema which defines the structure of each event in the table.
Schemas are inferred from the data you load into a table, however, some columns are required by Kaskada's data model.
Every table must include a column identifying the xref:fenl:temporal-aggregation.adoc[time] and xref:fenl:entities.adoc[entity] associated with each row. 

When creating a table, you must tell Kaskada which columns contain the time and entity of each row:

* The time column is specified using the `time_column_name` parameter.
  This parameter must identify a column name in the table's data which contains time values.
  The time should refer to when the event occurred.
* The xref:fenl:entities.adoc[entity] key is specified using the `entity_key_column_name` parameter.
  This parameter must identify a column name in the table's data which contains the entity key value.
  The entity key should identify a _thing_ in the world that each event is associated with.
  Don't worry too much about picking the "right" value - it's easy to change the entity using the `xref:fenl:catalog.adoc#with-key[with_key()]` function.

Start by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
./kaskada-cli table create Purchase  --timeColumn purchase_time --entityKeyColumn customer_id
----

> tableId: 1ba8ed9a-76bd-4302-b9fa-3c8655535f4a
> tableName: Purchase
> timeColumnName: purchase_time
> entityKeyColumnName: customer_id
> createTime: 2023-05-08T13:16:00.237166Z
> updateTime: 2023-05-08T13:16:00.237167Z
----
====


This creates a table named `Purchase`. Any data loaded into this table
must have a timestamp field named `purchase_time`, and a field named
`customer_id`.

[TIP]
.Idiomatic Kaskada
====
We like to use CamelCase to name tables because it
helps distinguish data sources from transformed values and function
names.
====


=== Loading data

Now that we've created a table, we're ready to load some data into it.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A table must be xref:#creating-a-table[created] before data can be loaded into it.
====

Data can be loaded into a table in multiple ways. In this example we'll
load the contents of a Parquet file into the table. 

****
⭢  Read more about the different ways to load data in xref:ROOT:loading-data.adoc[Loading Data]
****

[source,bash]
----
# Download a file to load and save it to path 'purchase.parquet'
curl -L "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1SLdIw9uc0RGHY-eKzS30UBhN0NJtslkk" -o purchase.parquet

# Load the file into the Purchase table (which was created in the previous step)
./kaskada-cli table load Purchase file://${PWD}/purchase.parquet
----

.Show result
[%collapsible]
====
[source,]
----
> Successfully loaded "purchases.parquet" into "Purchase" table
----
====

The file's content is added to the table.

== Querying data
Data loaded into Kaskada is accessed by performing Fenl Queries.

=== Identity query
Let's start by looking at the Purchase table without any filters.
Begin by creating a text file with the following query:

.query.fenl
include::partial$cli-purchase.adoc[]
 

This query will return all of the columns and rows contained in a table.
Run it by sending the query to `kaskada-cli query run`:

[source,bash]
----
cat query.fenl | ./kaskada-cli query run --stdout
----

.Show result
[%collapsible]
====
[source,]
----
Enter the expression to run and then press CTRL+D to execute it, or CTRL+C to cancel:

=== Filtering by a single Entity
It can be helpful to limit your results to a single entity.
This makes it easier to see how a single entity changes over time.

=== Complex Examples with Fenl functions

In this example, we build a pipeline of functions using the `|` character.
We begin with the timestream produced by the table `Purchase`, then filter it to the set of times where the purchase's customer is `"patrick"` using the `xref:fenl:catalog.adoc#when[when()]` function.

Kaskada's query language provides a rich set of xref:fenl:catalog.adoc[operations] for reasoning about time.
Here's a more sophisticated example that touches on many of the unique features of Kaskada queries:

.query.fenl
include::partial$cli-unique.adoc[]

****
⭢  Read more about writing queries in xref:developing:queries.adoc[]
****

=== Configuring query execution

A given query can be computed in different ways.
You can configure how a query is executed by providing arguments to the CLI command.

==== Changing how the result timestream is output

When you make a query, the resulting timestream is interpreted in one of two ways: as a history or as a snapshot.

* A timestream *History* generates a value each time there is a change in the value for the entity, and each row is associated with a different entity and point in time.
* A timestream *Snapshot* generates a value for each entity at the same point in time; each row is associated with a different entity, but all rows are associated with the same time.

By default, timestreams are output as histories.
You can output a timestream as a snapshot by setting the `--result-behavior` argument to `final-results`.

[source,Fenl]
----
cat query.fenl | ./kaskada-cli query run --result-behavior final-results
----

==== Limiting how many rows are returned

You can limit the number of rows returned from a query:

[source,Fenl]
----
cat query.fenl | ./kaskada-cli query run --preview-rows 10
----

[TIP]
====
This may return more rows that you asked for.
Kaskada computes data in batches. 
When you configure `--preview-rows` Kaskada stops processing at the end of a batch once the given number of rows have been computed, and returns all the rows that were computed.

== Cleaning Up

When you're done with this tutorial, you can delete the table you created in order to free up resources.  Note that this also deletes all of the data loaded into the table.

[source,bash]
----
# Delete the Purchase table
kaskada-cli table delete --table Purchase
----

== Conclusion

Congratulations, you've begun processing events with Kaskada!

Where you go now is up to you
