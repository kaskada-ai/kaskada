= Locally

Kaskada is an event-processing engine comprised of two main components:

* The `kaskada-engine` component is a stateful compute engine for transforming event data.
* The `kaskada-manager` is an (optionally) stateful API for communicating with clients


== Using Kaskada with Python

To use Kaskada with Python you'll need to have Python version 3.6 or above installed.
Once you have Python installed ensure that you can run it.
Open a terminal in your OS (command line prompt on Windows) and check the output of the following commands

.Verifying Kaskada prerequisites. The output on your machine may vary.
[source,bash]
----
python --version
# Python 3.10.6
----


.Installing Kaskada using pip
[source,bash]
----
pip install kaskada
----

[NOTE]
.Pip and pip3 and permissions
====
Depending on you Python installation and configuration you may have `pip3` instead of `pip` available in your terminal.
If you do have `pip3` replace `pip` with `pip3` in your command, i.e., `pip3 install kaskada`

If you get a permission error when running the `pip` command, you may

* need to run as an administrator using `sudo pip install kaskada`
* or use `pip`'s `--user` flag to install the package in your user directory for environments where you don't have administrator access (e.g., in Google Collab or other hosted environments).
====

Kaskada is now installed. Kaskada can be used locally by creating a local session.

.Creating a local Kaskada session in Python
[source,python]
----
from kaskada.api.session import LocalBuilder
session = LocalBuilder().build()
----

Creating a local session will download and run the Kaskada service as a non-persistent Python subprocess.
To connect to an existing Kaskada process, initialize the client with the appropriate endpoint.

.Creating a remote Kaskada session in Python
[source,python]
----
from kaskada import client
client.init(
  # The host and port of the Kaskada manager API.
  endpoint = "localhost:50051",

  # If true, TLS encryption will be required for the API connection.
  is_secure = False,

  # An (optional) string identifying the client.
  client_id = "python-client"
)

== Using Kaskada with IPython (Jupyter)

IPython is an interactive Python runtime used by Jupyter and other
notebooks to evaluate Python code blocks. IPython supports "magic
extensions" for customizing how code blocks are interpreted. Kaskada
provides a magic extension that simplifies querying Kaskada.

To use Kaskada within a Jupyter notebook you'll need to have the following pieces of software installed

. https://realpython.com/installing-python/[Python] (version 3.6 and above)
. https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html[Jupyter]

Once you have both prerequisites installed ensure that you can run them.
Open a terminal in your OS (command line prompt on Windows) and check the output of the following commands

.Verifying Kaskada prerequisites. The output shown here is from an Ubuntu system--the output on your machine may vary.
[source,bash]
----
python --version
# Python 3.10.6


jupyter --version

Kaskada's python library includes notebook customizations that allow us to write queries in the Fenl language but also receive and render the results of our queries in our notebooks.
We need to enable these customizations first before we can use them.

.Enable fenlmagic in this notebook
[source,ipython]
----
%load_ext fenlmagic
----

This will load the extension into the IPython context. You can verify
the install worked by initializing the extension:

[source,ipython]
----
%%fenl?
----

[source,bash]
----
  %fenl [--as-view AS_VIEW] [--data-token DATA_TOKEN] [--debug DEBUG]
            [--output OUTPUT] [--preview-rows PREVIEW_ROWS]
            [--result-behavior RESULT_BEHAVIOR] [--var VAR]

fenl query magic

optional arguments:
  --as-view AS_VIEW     adds the body as a view with the given name to all
                        subsequent fenl queries.
  --data-token DATA_TOKEN
                        A data token to run queries against. Enables
                        repeatable queries.
  --debug DEBUG         Shows debugging information
  --output OUTPUT       Output format for the query results. One of "df"
                        (default), "json", or "parquet".
  --preview-rows PREVIEW_ROWS
                        Produces a preview of the data with at least this many
                        rows.
  --result-behavior RESULT_BEHAVIOR
                        Determines which results are returned. Either "all-
                        results" (default), or "final-results" which returns
                        only the final values for each entity.
  --var VAR             Assigns the QueryResponse to a local variable with the given
                        name. The QueryResponse contains result_url, query and dataframe.

== Using Kaskada with the command line (CLI)

To use Kaskada on the command line, you'll need to install three components:

* The Kaskada command-line executable
* The Kaskada manager, which serves the Kaskada API
* The Kaskada engine, which executes queries

Each of these are available as pre-compiled binaries in the xref:url:https://github.com/kaskada-ai/kaskada/releases[Releases] section of Kaskada's Github repository.
This example assumes you have installed `curl`.

[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaskada-ai/kaskada/main/install/install.sh)"
----

To simplify running the Kaskada components you can move them to a directory in your path.
First, print a colon-separated list of the directories in your `PATH`.

[source,bash]
----
echo PATH
----

Move the Kaskada binaries to one of the listed locations.
This command assumes that the binaries are currently in your working directory and that your `PATH`` includes `/usr/local/bin`, but you can customize it if your locations are different.

[source,bash]
----
mv kaskada-* /usr/local/bin/
----

For more information about adding binaries to your path, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix[this StackOverflow article].

[TIP]
.Authorizing applications on OSX
====
If you're using OSX, you may need to unblock the applications.
OSX prevents applications you download from running as a security feature.
You can remove the block placed on the file when it was downloaded with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <path to file>
----
====

You should now be able to run all three components.
To verify they're installed correctly and executable, try running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kaskada-cli -h
----

You should see output similar to the following:

[source,]
----
A CLI tool for interacting with the Kaskada API

[source,bash]
----
kaskada-manager 2>&1 > manager.log 2>&1 &
kaskada-engine serve > engine.log 2>&1 &
----
