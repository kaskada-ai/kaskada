= Fenl Diagnostic Error Codes

== E0013

`error[E0013]: Invalid output type = Output type must be a record, but was X`

The values produced by all Fenl expressions must be a record. 
A record is a representation of multiple data types into a single value.
This error indicates that the offending query produces a non-record type.
To fix this, update the query to return a record type. For more information, see https://docs.kaskada.com/docs/data-model#records[Records]
