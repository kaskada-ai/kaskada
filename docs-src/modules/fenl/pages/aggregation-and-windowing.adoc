= Aggregation and Windowing 

Temporal computation is most important when dealing with aggregations,
because aggregations incorporate values associated with _different_
times.

== Basic Aggregations

We can think of aggregations as consuming a stream of input values and
producing a stream of output values. By default each time an aggregation
consumes an input it produces an output. In this case the time
associated with each output is the same as the time associated with the
corresponding input, and the output's value is the result of applying
the aggregation to all the inputs consumed up to that time.

== Windowed Aggregations

The default behavior of aggregations is to produce an output whose value
is an aggregation of all inputs seen to date each time an input is
consumed. This behavior can be controlled using windowed aggregations.

=== Controlling _What_ is Aggregated

The first aspect describes the set of input values used in an
aggregation. The default behavior is for every input value to
contribute. In some cases it may be preferable to only include the N
most recent inputs, or to include every input since a particular event
occurred.

=== Controlling _When_ is Aggregated

The second aspect describes when the result of the aggregation should be
produced. The default behavior is to produce an output value every time
an input value is consumed. In some cases it may be preferable to
produce an output value at the end of each day, when a particular event
occurs.

=== Windowing Examples

Aggregations may be windowed by providing a _window generator_ for the
aggregation's `window` parameter. For example the
`sliding(2, is_valid(Purchase))` window generator computes the sum of
the _two most recent_ valid purchases.

The `sliding(n, bool)` window generator affects _what_ is aggregated but
retains the default _when_ behavior of producing an output associated
with each input.

The `yearly()` window generator can be used to compute the
total of all purchases at the beginning of each year.

====
Yearly windows produce values at the end of the window,
but when should we _stop_ producing windows? The set of times associated
with events is finite and known when a computation takes place, but
there is an unbounded number of year boundaries.

To avoid producing unbounded results, Fenl limits "cron-style" windows
to time intervals that begin before the newest event and end after the
oldest event in the dataset, across all entities.
====

== Repeated Aggregation

Events may be aggregated multiple times. The events themselves are a
sequence of timestamped data for each entity. The result of the first
aggregation is the same â€” a sequence of timestamped data for each
entity. Applying an additional aggregation simply aggregates over those
times. For example, we can compute the average purchase amount sum.
