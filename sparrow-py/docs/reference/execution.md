# Execution

There are several ways to execute a Timestream.
The {py:meth}`run method <sparrow_py.Timestream.run>` executes the Timestream over the current data, and produces a {py:class}`Result <sparrow_py.Result>`.

## Result
```{eval-rst}
.. autoclass:: sparrow_py.Result
    :exclude-members: __init__
    :members:
```
