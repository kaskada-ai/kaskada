See also [`round`](#round) and [`ceil`](#ceil).

### Parameters
* n: The number to round down.

Note: This method may be applied to any numeric type. For anything other than
`float32` and `float64` it has no affect since the values are already integers.

### Results
Returns a numeric column of the same type as `n`.
The result contains `null` if `n` was null at that row.
Otherwise, it contains the result of rounding `n` down to the next smallest integer.
