This is the function used for the unary operation `-n`.

### Parameters
* n: The number to be negated.

Note: If `n` is an unsigned integer type it is promoted to
a signed type following the
[numeric type coercion rules](docs:data-model#numeric-type-coercion-table).
If it is an unsigned integer type other than `u64`, it is promoted to the next wider
signed integer type. If it is `u64` it is promoted to `f64`.

### Results
For each row in the input, returns `null` if `n` is `null`.
Otherwise, returns the negation of `n`.
