short_doc = "Looks up the value for a foreign key."
long_doc = """
Performs a lookup join between the `key` and the computed `value` from a foreign entity.

### Parameters
* key: Expression which computes the foreign key to lookup.
  This must match the type of the keys in the foreign grouping.
* value: Foreign expression computing the value to lookup.
  The `value` argument should normally be a continuous value (result of an aggregation).
  This ensures there will be an available value at the time of the lookup.

### Results
For each row with a non-`null` key, returns the value at that time from the `value` computed for the entity identified by the `key`.
Yields `null` if the `key` is `null` or if there is no foreign value computed for that key at the corresponding time.
