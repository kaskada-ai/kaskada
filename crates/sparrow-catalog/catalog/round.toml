See also [`ceil`](#ceil) and [`floor`](#floor).

### Parameters
* n: The number to round.

Note: This method may be applied to any numeric type. For anything other than
`float32` and `float64` it has no affect since the values are already integers.

### Results
Returns a numeric column of the same type as `n`.
The result contains `null` if `n` was null at that position.
Otherwise, it contains the result of rounding `n` to the nearest integer.

Numbers half-way between two integers are rounded away from `0`.
For example, `0.5` rounds to `1.0` and `-0.5` rounds to `-1.0`.
