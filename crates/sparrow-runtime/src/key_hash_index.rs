/// Stores an index mapping key hashes to an index.

/// Multiple key hash indices may be needed for the same grouping. Consider
/// a computation such as `TableFoo | when(predicate) | ...` which contains
/// two passes -- one over the contents of `TableFoo` and the other over the
/// contents matching the `predicate`. Even though the grouping is the same,
/// the second pass will only contain entities that have had at least one
/// event matching the predicate.
///
/// Currently, we handle this by having a separate `KeyHashIndex` for each
/// pass. If this becomes too much to store, we could explore strategies
/// that allow sharing them -- when possible. For instance:
///
/// 1. We could map entities to indices in a bit set, and then have each
///    pass maintain a bit set indicating which entities have been seen.
///    We could determine the actual index based on the number of `1s`
///    in the range `[0, index_in_bit_set]`.
/// 2. We could determine cases where the index *should* be the same. For
///    instance, if anything is buffered between the first pass and the
///    second then all entities discovered by the first pass will be
///    discovered by the second.
