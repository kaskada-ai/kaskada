  - name: Timestream.Aggregation
    desc: |
      The User Guide has details on [aggregations in general](../guide/aggregation.qmd).

      ::: {.callout-important}
      It is important to remember that aggregations are partitioned by entity and windowed, with the default behavior being cumulative up to the current time.
      :::

  - name: Timestream.Arithmetic
    desc: |
      Timestreams support a variety of arithmetic operations.

      ::: {.callout-important}
      In addition to the chainable methods, standard operators are implemented where appropriate.
      For instance, `a.add(b)` may be written as `a + b`.
      See the notes on the specific functions for more information.
      :::

  - name: Timestream.Collection
    desc: |
      Timestreams allow each point to contain a collection -- a `list` or `map` -- of elements.

  - name: Timestream.Comparision
    desc: |
      Comparison operations produce boolean Timestreams.

      ::: {.callout-important}
      In addition to the chainable methods, standard operators are implemented where appropriate.
      For instance, `a.ge(b)` may be written as `a >= b`.
      See the notes on the specific functions for more information.

      To respect the semantics of `__eq__` and `__ne__`, `a == b` and `a != b` are *not* overloaded.
      :::

  - name: Timestream.Records
    desc: |
      Record operations create, extract or manipulate Timestreams of records.
