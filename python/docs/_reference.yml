    - subtitle: Aggregation
      desc: |
        The User Guide has details on [aggregations in general](../../../guide/aggregation.qmd).

        ::: {.callout-important}
        It is important to remember that aggregations are partitioned by entity and windowed, with the default behavior being cumulative up to the current time.

    - subtitle: Arithmetic
      desc: |
        Timestreams support a variety of arithmetic operations.

        ::: {.callout-important}
        In addition to the chainable methods, standard operators are implemented where appropriate.
        For instance, `a.add(b)` may be written as `a + b`.
        See the notes on the specific functions for more information.

      desc: |
        Timestreams allow each point to contain a collection -- a `list` or `map` -- of elements.

    - subtitle: Comparison
      desc: |
        Comparison operations produce boolean Timestreams.

        ::: {.callout-important}
        In addition to the chainable methods, standard operators are implemented where appropriate.
        For instance, `a.ge(b)` may be written as `a >= b`.
        See the notes on the specific functions for more information.

        To respect the semantics of `__eq__` and `__ne__`, `a == b` and `a != b` are *not* overloaded.
