    "# Time-centric Calculations\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaskada was built to process and perform temporal calculations on event streams,\n",
    "with real-time analytics and machine learning in mind. It is not exclusively for\n",
    "real-time applications, but Kaskada excels at time-centric computations and\n",
    "aggregations on event-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say you're building a user analytics dashboard at an\n",
    "ecommerce retailer. You have event streams showing all actions the user has\n",
    "taken, and you'd like to include in the dashboard:\n",
    "* the total number of events the user has ever generated\n",
    "* the total number of purchases the user has made\n",
    "* the total revenue from the user\n",
    "* the number of purchases made by the user today\n",
    "* the total revenue from the user today\n",
    "* the number of events the user has generated in the past hour\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the calculations needed here are a mix of hourly, daily, and over all of\n",
    "history, more than one type of event aggregation needs to happen. Table-centric\n",
    "tools like those based on SQL would require multiple JOINs and window functions,\n",
    "which would be spread over multiple queries or CTEs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kaskada was designed for these types of time-centric calculations, so we can do\n",
    "each of the calculations in the list in one line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "record({\n",
    "    \"event_count_total\": DemoEvents.count(),\n",
    "    \"purchases_total_count\": DemoEvents.filter(DemoEvents.col(\"event_name\").eq(\"purchase\")).count(),\n",
    "    \"revenue_total\": DemoEvents.col(\"revenue\").sum(),\n",
    "    \"purchases_daily\": DemoEvents.filter(DemoEvents.col(\"event_name\").eq(\"purchase\")).count(window=Daily()),\n",
    "    \"revenue_daily\": DemoEvents.col(\"revenue\").sum(window=Daily()),\n",
    "    \"event_count_hourly\": DemoEvents.count(window=Hourly()),\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "The previous example demonstrates the use of `Daily()` and `Hourly()` windowing which aren't yet part of the new Python library.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a few more lines of code are needed to put these calculations to work,\n",
    "but these six lines are all that is needed to specify the calculations\n",
    "themselves. Each line may specify:\n",
    "* the name of a calculation (e.g. `event_count_total`)\n",
    "* the input data to start with (e.g. `DemoEvents`)\n",
    "* selecting event fields (e.g. `DemoEvents.col(\"revenue\")`)\n",
    "* function calls (e.g. `count()`)\n",
    "* event filtering (e.g. `filter(DemoEvents.col(\"event_name\").eq(\"purchase\"))`)\n",
    "* time windows to calculate over (e.g. `window=Daily()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "...with consecutive steps chained together in a familiar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because Kaskada was built for time-centric calculations on event-based data, a\n",
    "calculation we might describe as \"total number of purchase events for the user\"\n",
    "can be defined in Kaskada in roughly the same number of terms as the verbal\n",
    "description itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue through the demo below to find out how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the Kaskada documentation](../guide/index) for lots more information."

    "calculation values at any point in time. Traditional query languages (e.g. SQL)\n",
    "can only return data that already exists---if we want to return a row of\n",
    "computed/aggregated data, we have to compute the row first, then return it. As a\n",
    "specific example, suppose we have SQL queries that produce daily aggregations\n",
    "over event data, and now we want to have the same aggregations on an hourly\n",

    "queries would look very similar to the daily ones, but they would still be\n",
    "different queries.\n",

    "With Kaskada, we can define the calculations once, and then specify the points\n",
