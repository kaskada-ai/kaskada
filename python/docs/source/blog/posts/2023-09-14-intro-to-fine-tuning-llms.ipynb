       "# Intro\n",
       "\n",
       "As a contributor to the [Kaskada](http://kaskada.io/kaskada) open-source project, I've always been driven by the immense potential of today's technology. In this post, I'll discuss my learnings around fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). As an example, I'll use my work on [BeepGPT](https://github.com/kaskada-ai/beep-gpt), where I set out to build a customized, real-time model to predict which Slack conversations might different users find interesting.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, I'd like to say that I am not a Data Scientist. I've worked with a few Data Scientists, but my knowledge in the space is limited. With the advent of high-quality LLMs, software engineers like me can now delve into Data Science with little-to-no Data Science background.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, why should you care? Because the line between Data Science professionals and enthusiasts like you and me is becoming delightfully blurred. Dive in to explore how I ventured into the domain of Data Scientists and what I uncovered along the way.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Here are a few tips before we get started\n",
       "\n",
       "First is a willingness to experiment. Model fine-tuning is an iterative process. The first way you build your training examples will likely not produce a successful model. When working on BeepGPT I experimented with five different approaches (over a week) before I found one that was successful at predicting user interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Second is the importance of data quality. When fine-tuning a model, numerous training examples are sent to a model to update its behavior. The examples must contain strong signals that relate to the desired output. Despite the recent advances made with LLMs, garbage in still leads to garbage out. [see: @gigo]\n",
       "\n",
       "One trick I developed was using LLMs to help make decisions about the quality of each example. With few-shot learning, I taught a model what strong signals look like, and I was able to use that to enhance the quality of my dataset.\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, it is vital to have many training examples. Ideally, a fine-tuning job should be run with at least a few thousand training examples. The more examples you can provide to the model, the more it can learn, and the better the predictions will be in production."

       "# Definitions\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Large Language Model (LLM)\n",
       "\n",
       "A large language model is an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. [@llm]\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Tokens\n",
       "LLMs process text as tokens instead of as characters. Tokens represent sets of characters that commonly occur in a specific sequence. On average, a token represents about four characters. You can use [OpenAI's tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to see how different texts get converted into tokens, for example:\n",
       "\n",
       "::: {.sourceCode}\n",
       "<pre class=\"sourceCode\"><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-0\" title=\"15592\">Team</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-1\" title=\"11\">,</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-2\" title=\"750\"> did</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-3\" title=\"345\"> you</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-4\" title=\"2883\"> enjoy</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-0\" title=\"262\"> the</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-1\" title=\"299\"> n</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-2\" title=\"620\">ach</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-3\" title=\"418\">os</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn tokenizer-tkn-4\" title=\"7415\"> yesterday</span><span class=\"tokenizer-tkn \n",
       "tokenizer-tkn-0\" title=\"30\">?</span></pre>\n",
       ":::\n",
       "\n",
       "The color highlighting shows how 41 characters become 11 tokens. You can mouse over to see the actual token values.\n",
       "\n",
       "Common words and most positive integers under 1000 equate to a single token. Whitespace and capitalization matter: ` Team`, ` team`, `Team`, and `team` equate to four different tokens.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Prompts & Completions\n",
       "Prompts are the input to LLMs. If you have played with ChatGPT before, the request you sent was a prompt.\n",
       "\n",
       "Completions are the outputs from LLMs. With ChatGPT, the response to your question was a completion.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Training Examples\n",
       "Training examples are prompt & completion pairs. The prompt is the text we would have sent to the model, and the completion is the response we would have expected. \n",
       "\n",
       "#### Maximum Token Length\n",
       "The maximum length of an API request to a model, in tokens. Depending on the model, there is a different maximum length. \n",
       "\n",
       "#### Few-Shot Learning\n",
       "\n",
       "Few-shot learning is a method of working with language models to improve response quality for specific tasks. It works by including training examples on each request to a model, demonstrating the desired response behavior. For example, when playing with ChatGPT:\n",
       "\n",
       "```{.default .code-overflow-wrap}\n",
       "> I'd like you to identify if an animal passed to you is a bird or not-a-bird. Here are some examples:\n",
       "> Penguin: bird\n",
       "> Rabbit: not-a-bird\n",
       "> Parrot:\n",
       "```\n",
       "::: {.center} \n",
       "`Penguin: bird` and `Rabbit: not-a-bird` are few-shot examples. \n",
       ":::\n",
       "\n",
       "Few-shot learning helps adapt an existing LLM to perform a new task quickly. However, it is limited by the Maximum Token Length of the model. If you are trying to train a model to do a complex behavior, you might not be able to include all your desired training examples in a single request. Additionally, the cost and response time increase as the number of tokens you send increases.\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Model Fine-Tuning\n",
       "\n",
       "Fine-tuning is the process of re-training existing base language models (like GPT3) with new datasets to perform specific tasks. Fine-tuning improves on few-shot learning by training on many more examples than can fit in a single request. \n",
       "\n",
       "Continuing the previous example, we could fine-tune an existing model by providing a file containing hundreds of animals labeled `bird` or `not-a-bird`. The output of this would be a new model that would be more efficient at this specific task. \n",
       "\n",
       "Making requests to a fine-tuned model is generally cheaper and faster than sending few-shot learning requests. However, the process of fine-tuning a model itself can be quite expensive.\n",
       "\n",
       "It is important to weigh the tradeoffs between few-shot learning and model fine-tuning."

       "### Hypothesis generation\n",
       "\n",
       "Before we start building training examples, you need to form hypotheses about what you want to predict and how you might do so successfully. This is where the iterative process starts.\n",

       "For BeepGPT I experimented with the following ideas: \n",

Furthermore, Kaskada ensures that your examples will not be subject to leakage, which is a big problem in predictive modeling.
